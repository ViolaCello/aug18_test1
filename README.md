# Aug18Test1

Welcome to the Covid-19 live statistics tracker.

In this project, a user is able to choose from a list of eight countries from different regions around the world.  Once a choice is made, the user is prompted as to which statistic about the country they would like to know concerning Covid-19.  The choices are: Confirmed case, Recovered cases, Critical cases, and the number of deaths.  Once the user has made the choice as to which statistic they wanted returned to them, they are then prompted with another choice as to whether they would care to compare the number that was just returned to them with the World statistics of the same category.  If the user answers in the affirmative, the gross number of the world statistic in question is displayed, and then a mathematical computation as to what percentage did this particular country add to the world's total.  The user can continue through and find information about any/all of teh eight countries provided.
